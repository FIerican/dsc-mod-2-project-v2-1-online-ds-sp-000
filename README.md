## Business Opportunity

This project will examine the King County House Sales dataset and come up with a model using multivariate linear regression to predict the sale price of houses as accurately as possible, while also examining what factors most influence the average sale price of a home. 

The experiment is to determine if there are certain factors that can be taken advantage of to maximize a resident's profit when selling their home.
